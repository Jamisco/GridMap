The Objective of this program is to find a more efficient and effective means to generate large tile maps

 - We hope to complete this projects in 2 weeks. (oof)
 
 
 - The tile map should allow individual access and manipulation of tiles, 
	- Both visually and logically

- The map should be able to generate a 1000 x 1000 map in less than 1 second
	---- HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAA, LESS THAN A SECOND, BOY WAS I AMBITIOUS
- The map will allow for the user to use different materials in order to generate their wanted textures

- possible, there should be heights

--------------------------------------

NEW GOALS

------------------------

- Hex can either be pointy top or flat top
- Each has can have a maximum of

-------------- New Goals ------------------------------

	MUST be completed by the end of January

- The goal hence forth is to create a map that can be used for a game. Any 2d (with slight 3d) maps should be able to create with this why the use of materials.
	- 3d is optional but preferred

- Map Should support square tiles and hex tiles, with the ability to change the size of the hexes
	- Hexes should be able to be pointy top or flat top
	- Squares can be rectangular or square

- Map must have Procedural generation aspects in mine but MUST also have unity editor map builder

- Map must be able to be saved and loaded
- Map must support both sprites and materials and colors
- Map will not have animation
	- User can add animation to the map if they want to
- Map will have no lighting in the materials themselves
	- We will be using unity lighting and praying to God that it works

- Map should possible have a better way to shape the hexes,
	- Each tile will have an option to set the number of vertices for it
	
- Map should have colliders
	- colliders can be disabled

- shader should have tiling options for their materials

- User can mark specific tiles to be the considered as their own seperate entity
- Tile spacing
- You can highlight with a circle

The Objective of this program is to find a more efficient and effective means to generate large tile maps

 - We hope to complete this projects in 2 weeks.
 
 
 - The tile map should allow individual access and manipulation of tiles, 
	- Both visually and logically

- The map should be able to generate a 1000 x 1000 map in less than 1 second
- The map will allow for the user to use different materials in order to generate their wanted textures

- possible, there should be heights

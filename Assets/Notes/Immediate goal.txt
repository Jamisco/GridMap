For the hex chunk, 
add funcitonality for layered mesh

Layermesh will be layer over or below the mesh chunk
Layermesh will use unity built in LayerMask to determine which layer it will be on
Layermesh will have a means to set order in layer

Layermesh can be instanced
	- it will be the hex chunk that will loop through all layers and draw them if instanced
